    <h1>Song About the World</h1>
    <p>Hereâ€™s a song dedicated to the beauty of the world:</p>

    <pre>
    The world is wide, so full of wonder,
    Mountains rise, rivers run under.
    The skies so blue, the fields so green,
    A home for all, a perfect scene.

    Oceans whisper, forests sing,
    Every dawn new life they bring.
    A world of beauty, vast and free,
    A treasure for you, a treasure for me.

    Let's care for Earth, our only home,
    Through every land, where we may roam.
    Protect its beauty, let it thrive,
    Together we'll keep this world alive.
    </pre>
